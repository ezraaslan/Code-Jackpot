# Code Jackpot 🎰

**Code Jackpot** is an educational productivity tool designed to inspire a love of coding by turning focused work into a game.

Users wager *fake money* on themselves, write real code, and earn better odds by staying active and reducing syntax errors. At the end of a session, a slot-machine-style reward determines whether they cash out a jackpot.

This tool is meant to encourage **focus, consistency, and learning** — not gambling.

## Purpose

Coding timers usually only track time.  
Code Helper tracks **effort**.

It rewards:
- Writing new lines of code
- Fixing syntax errors
- Staying active (AFK penalties apply)
- Defining functions and making meaningful changes

The goal is to make learning and productivity feel **engaging and fun**, especially for students and beginners.

## How It Works

1. Choose a file you plan to work on
2. Set a coding duration
3. Wager fake money from your balance
4. Start coding

Behind the scenes, Code Helper:
- Monitors file changes
- Tracks AFK time
- Detects syntax errors
- Adjusts your odds dynamically

At the end of the session, a slot machine rolls:
- **Win** → your wager is doubled
- **Lose** → wager is lost

Balances persist between sessions.
